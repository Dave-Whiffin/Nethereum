# How to contribute
One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on our Gitter channel https://gitter.im/Nethereum/Nethereum.  We do encourage and accept PR's providing the guidance below is followed.

Much of our guidelines are the same as for .Net Core https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

## General feedback and discussions?
Please use our Gitter channel https://gitter.im/Nethereum/Nethereum.

## Bugs and feature requests?
Before raising an issue on GitHub for a question or feature request or bug, please try Gitter first.  It is important that bugs and feature requests are verified on Gitter before a GitHub issue is raised.  Please don't raise questions as GitHub issues, use Gitter instead.

## PR's
We welcome pull requests with code changes that follow our guidelines.  It is strongly recommended that any PR's reference a GitHub issue on our repo. Before committing to work on a PR please contact us via Gitter to verify that the PR is worthwhile and consistent with our roadmap.

## Contributing code and content

We accept fixes and features.  These resources will help you contribute.

* ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.
* If there are no "Help Wanted" issues by all means see what's there and get in touch if you'd like to help.

### Identifying the scale
(As per .Net Core contribution guidelines)

> If you would like to contribute, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute. If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working ?on a fix. If you are submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the team via Gitter and ensure it follows the product roadmap. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. All code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

### Submitting a pull request
(As per .Net Core contribution guidelines)

> If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests. Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. The coding, style, and general engineering guidelines are published on the [Engineering guidelines](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines) page.

### Tests
(Exactly As per .Net Core contribution guidelines)

> -  Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
> - Tests only need to be present for issues that need to be verified by QA (for example, not tasks)
> -  If there is a scenario that is far too hard to test there does not need to be a test for it.
>  - "Too hard" is determined by the team as a whole.

### Feedback
(As per .Net Core contribution guidelines)

> Your pull request will now go through extensive checks by the subject matter experts on our team. Please be patient as we're a small team. Update your pull request according to feedback until it is approved by one of the team members. After that, one of our team members may adjust the branch you merge into based on the expected release schedule.
